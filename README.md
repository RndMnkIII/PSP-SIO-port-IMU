# PSP-SIO-port-IMU

## RndMnkIII 2018
Example using MPU-6050 sensor as IMU thanks to the Kalman filter library
by Kristian Lauszus, to convert the raw data from the sensor to float values
representing the x and y axis rotation values. This values are converted to a
byte array and transfered to the PSP SIO port using the Teensy 3.2 UART2 at 9600bps.
The UART2 port is connected to the PSP console SIO port using a bidirectional
voltage level converter between for converting from 3.3v Teensy 3.2 logic level
to the PSP SIO 2.5v logic level using a sparkfun logic level shifter.
