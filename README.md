# PSP-SIO-port-IMU

## RndMnkIII 2018
Example using MPU-6050 sensor as IMU thanks to the Kalman filter library
by Kristian Lauszus, to convert the raw data from the sensor to float values
representing the x and y axis rotation values. This values are converted to a
byte array and transfered to the PSP SIO port using the Teensy 3.2 UART2 at 9600bps.
The UART2 port is connected to the PSP console SIO port using a bidirectional
voltage level converter between for converting from 3.3v Teensy 3.2 logic level
to the PSP SIO 2.5v logic level using a sparkfun logic level shifter.

This repository contains two project folders:
- Arduino sketch with the code for the Teensy 3.2 board. Install the Kalman library
  from https://github.com/TKJElectronics/KalmanFilter in the Arduino\libraries folder.
  
- Gcc Make project for the PSP DevKit cross compiler that generates the EBOOT.PBP file 
  for copy to the PSP memory stick PSP\GAME150\celshading folder with the lightmap.raw
  resource file. The SDK for Windows can be downloaded from:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/minpspw/
